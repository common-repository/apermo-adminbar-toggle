This plugin simple allows you to toggle the AdminBar on and off just with the keyboard.

## Description ##

The Plugin adds a simple keyboard shortcut for mac and windows, and allows you to hide or show the adminbar in the frontend, very handy for themes using a sticky navigation.
It is the smaller brother of my plugin [Apermo AdminBar](https://wordpress.org/plugins/apermo-adminbar/) which contains the same functionality and more advanced features.

If you want to participate in the development [head over to GitHub](https://github.com/apermo/apermo-adminbar)!

2. Activate the 'Apermo AdminBar Toggle' plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Go to the Frontend and hit `ALT + SHIFT + A` to toggle the AdminBar

Go to the Frontend and hit `ALT + SHIFT + A` to toggle the AdminBar.

Yes, at this point that is a desired behavior. If enough people demand it, I might add a functionality to change this behavior in the future. Just contact me on WordPress.org (@apermo) or on Twitter (@ChristophDaumDe)
